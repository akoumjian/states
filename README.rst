My Salt states
==============

This uses a modified version of `Salt`_ which adds `Sentry`_ support for
remote debugging. If you don't need this, simply change ``salt-raven`` to
``salt`` in the fabfile and the salt state.

.. _Salt: http://saltstack.org/
.. _Sentry: http://sentry.readthedocs.org/

Installation
------------

* On a bare ubuntu machine, create a ``$HOME/salt`` folder and clone this repo
  in it.

* Create a ``$HOME/salt/salt.conf`` file with the following content::

      SALT_MASTER = <salt master IP>
      env.user = <your user>
      env.index_url = <your index url for pip>

  (``env.index_url`` is optional if you're not installing ``salt-raven``).

* Create a virtualenv and install ``Fabric`` and ``Jinja2`` in it::

      cd $HOME/salt
      virtualenv env --system-site-packages
      env/bin/pip install Fabric Jinja2

* Bootstrap the master::

      cd states
      ../env/bin/fab -H <master ip> enable_salt:master

And to create minions, set their hostnames and do::

    ../env/bin/fab -H <minion ip> enable_salt:minion

Usage
-----

You need some pillar data:

* ``salt.master``: the IP / resolvable hostname of your salt master.

* ``index_url``: the index from which you'll install python packages.

* ``user``: the user in which home directory salt is installed.

* ``salt.sentry_dsn``: (optional) the Sentry DSN for logging what happens in
  salt.

This looks like this::

    user: example
    index_url: http://pypi.python.org/simple

    salt:
      master: 192.168.1.0
      sentry_dsn: https://â€¦
